# Python for Computer Vision with OpenCV and Deep Learning

This repository contains my complete set of exercises, notebooks, and Python scripts from
the [Python for Computer Vision with OpenCV and Deep Learning](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-computer-vision-with-opencv-and-deep-learning/?couponCode=LETSLEARNNOW)
by Udemy. The course covers everything from image basics and OpenCV to deep learning using Keras — including practical
tasks like object detection, tracking, and building CNNs on real-world datasets.

## 🧾 Structure

Each module folder contains:

- 📓 `.ipynb` Jupyter notebooks for visual walkthroughs
- 🐍 `.py` script versions of the same logic
- 🎯 Assessments or practical exercises at the end of many sections

---

## 📸 Highlights

- Built live object trackers using OpenCV APIs
- Applied YOLO v3 on real-world images
- Trained CNNs on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and custom image datasets
- Implemented interactive tools using OpenCV (e.g., drawing with the mouse)

---

## 📝 Notes

- Some files include visual outputs (images/video frames) and require camera access.
- You may need to install OpenCV with video support:

```shell
pip install opencv-python opencv-contrib-python
```
